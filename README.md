# Game Projects

This project was made in Python (Version 3.7) using the turtle module. This program is an arcade game which allows us to play with friends.


To run the program you must follow the following instructions:

´´´
sh
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd pong
python3 pong.py
```

To convert the program into a desktop application we must convert the file to .exe, we do this in the following way:  
 
´´´
sh
let's go to the terminal
We go to the folder where the project is
We execute the following command:
pyinstaller --clean --onefile --windowed pong.py
```
